Mac users : Installing the boost library using Homebrew causes issues with building mgiza. Please compile the Boost library from source using instructions in the section "Manually Installing Boost" at this URL : http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Development.GetStarted

NOTE: Boost Version 1.48 has problem with the code, you can use either 1.46 or 1.50+. Unfortunately 1.48 is shipped with Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, you can either download and compile libboost 1.50+ from their website, or just do this:

sudo apt-get install libboost1.46-all-dev
